  text="""I defended my PhD in 2022. At Oxford, I was a member of [Pier Palamara's group](https://palamaralab.github.io/). We developed a method, ARG-Needle, to infer the genome-wide genealogy of a set of genetic samples from genotyping array or sequencing data. We built the genome-wide genealogy of 337K samples in the UK Biobank and scanned the genealogy for associations with 7 complex traits. This yielded more rare and ultra-rare associations than found by genotype imputation, which were overall enriched for loss-of-function variation. See [our paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01379-x) in Nature Genetics or [my thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c4e8fb87-618b-4ca1-ad04-16f415ce5021).

		name = "Biobank-Scale Ancestral Recombination Graph Inference"
		description  = "In population genetics, the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) captures the history of coalescence, recombination, and mutation events that gives rise to observed genetic data. We developed a method, ARG-Needle, that leverages coalescent modeling for ascertained genotyping array data to infer accurate, biobank-scale ARGs from SNP arrays. We also developed a framework for performing mixed-model association of unobserved variation implied by an inferred ARG. Using these methods, we inferred the ARG of 337,464 individuals in the UK Biobank and performed genealogy-based association of 7 complex traits, recapitulating as well as detecting complementary associations compared to reference-based imputation. As these methods only require SNP array data, we anticipate they will be particularly relevant for populations that are currently undersequenced."

Standard inference under the mixed model does not scale to modern genetic datasets, so my PhD supervisors and I were looking to build on past methods like BOLT-LMM and LDpred to further improve the scalability of mixed model association. Although I have put the project on pause, my work in this area led me to write a set of expository notes on the mathematics of linear mixed models. (In progress, last modified February 2020.)"
